# INSTALLATION

The preferred method of installation is via Packagist, as this provides the PSR-0 autoloader functionality.

The following composer.json will download and install the latest version of the Uuid library into your project:

```
{
    "require": {
        "troymccabe/web-bbyopen": "*"
    }
}
```
